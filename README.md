# font-awesome-bootstrap-extension
Bootstrap uses about 200 hundred different glyphicons. Font awesome includes nearly 600. With this extension you can add glyphicons to bootstrap.

Some glyphicons are twice. But the most glyhpicons which you can add with this extension are new one.

With font-awesome you uses as example fa fa-bus as glyphicon. Now you can use it with glyphicon glyphicon-bus as equal as the syntax in bootstrap is. The first look means, that this doesn't mean a big change. And the second could be that a class can be exists two times.

I deleted all allready existing class in the css file. Another big advantage is if you have experience with font awesome and you know the class of a glyphicon that you can now use the name of the glyphicon easily in bootstrap (glyphicon glyphicon-[iconname]).

So there would be some icons which a declared two or maybe three times.

But you can be sure that you have now round about 600 glyphicons which you can use.

A free package of glyphicons can be downloaded from here:
http://glyphicons.com/    --> currently 800's are free. Maybe I update my work.

The font awesome font files, which you have to put into you root/fonts folder you can download from here:

I hope it's a little bit helpful
